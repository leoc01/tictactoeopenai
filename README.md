# tictactoeopenai
A tic tac toe game made with OpenAI

Talk to yout computer, some times it understads. I was not able to do everything I wanted and it is not beautiful, but ok, just a proof of concept.

/* create a 3x3 table */

/* center it */

/* clear the cells */

/* make each cell 50px square */

/* each odd click put an X inside the cell, each even click put an O */

/* create a reset button that erase the cell */

/* make the button erase the cell and reset var x */

/* after each click check if there are 3 cells equal horizontally, vertically or diagonally, if so change the button text saying X or O won and blocking new clicks on the cells until the button is clicked */

/* put the button in the midle f the screen */

/* make the background green */

/* make the table white */

/* make the cell content centered */

/* change the background to light green */

/* change the font color in the cells to blue */

/* put an message after the reset button: "Tic Tac Toe made with OpenAI, refresh the page to reset the game". */

/* center the text */

/* make the table margin 10% */
